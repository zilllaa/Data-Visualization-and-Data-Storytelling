## Introduction

Data storytelling is creating a narrative that explains the insights derived from data. It involves selecting and presenting data through visualizations, combining them into a coherent narrative, and effectively communicating your findings to your audience. This repository serves as a guide to help you create engaging and informative data stories.

## Why Data Visualization Matters

Data visualization is the cornerstone of effective data storytelling. It helps in:

- **Understanding Data**: Visualizations provide an intuitive way to grasp complex data.

- **Spotting Trends**: Patterns and trends become evident when data is presented visually.

- **Engaging Audiences**: Visual elements captivate the audience and make data more accessible.

- **Informing Decision-Making**: Data-driven decisions are more informed and effective.

Based on the data, Non-fiction books dominate the reviewed book category, representing a substantial 56% share, while fiction books make up the remaining 44% of the reviewed books. This suggests that non-fiction literature tends to generate more reader engagement and feedback compared to their fictional counterparts.

In this dataset of 550 book user ratings, we can observe rating distribution on a scale from 0 to 5. The most common rating is 4.8, which accounts for approximately 23% of all ratings. Following closely, ratings of 4.7 and 4.6 are also quite popular, making up about 19.6% and 19.1% of all ratings, respectively. This insight provides a clear picture of the distribution of user ratings in the dataset over 81.7% of ratings are 4.5 or higher, indicating that users have positively rated majority of books in the dataset.

Based on the data for the top 10 authors with multiple book publications, we find that Jeff Kinney leads the list with 2.2%. Gary Chapman, Suzanne Collins, and Rick Riordan are in the same tier, each with 2% of the total books published. This suggests that Jeff Kinney may be a favorite among readers.

### Distribution Of Reviews Over The Years

Looking at the distribution data above, we observe that in 2015, the fiction genre accounted for the highest percentage of book reviews at 8.6%. Interestingly, this genre experienced only a slight decline to 4.6% in 2018. However, by the end 2019, it rebounded, representing 6.7% of the total reviews.

In contrast, the non-fiction genre peaked in 2018 with 5.4% of total reviews and remained steady at 5.1% in 2019. Nevertheless, it still lags behind the fiction genre regarding the total reviews.

In this dataset of book sale profits by year, we observe that fiction books consistently comprised a lower percentage of profits compared to non-fiction. In 2010, non-fiction books accounted for approximately 71% of total profits, whereas fiction books comprised about 29%. This trend continued in subsequent years. It is notable that while both fiction and non-fiction profits fluctuated annually, the dominance of non-fiction remained evident throughout the years, with a substantial 64.6% of total profits in 2019.
