## Introduction

Data storytelling is creating a narrative that explains the insights derived from data.

- **Spotting Trends**: Patterns and trends become evident when data is presented visually.

- **Engaging Audiences**: Visual elements captivate the audience and make data more accessible.

- **Informing Decision-Making**: Data-driven decisions are more informed and effective.

Looking at the distribution data above, we observe that in 2015, the fiction genre accounted for the highest percentage of book reviews at 8.6%. Interestingly, this genre experienced only a slight decline to 4.6% in 2018. However, by the end 2019, it rebounded, representing 6.7% of the total reviews.

In contrast, the non-fiction genre peaked in 2018 with 5.4% of total reviews and remained steady at 5.1% in 2019. Nevertheless, it still lags behind the fiction genre regarding the total reviews.
